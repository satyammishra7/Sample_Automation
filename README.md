#Sample_Automation

Here, I automated one scenario of Amazon, i.e

open amazon.in,
search for lg soundbar,
read product names and associated main price on 1st search result page.
Put all product name and price in key value pair,
Use code to sort via price and print it 1 by 1,
where ever price is not present, consider it as zero.
